## History of APCs at the SNSF

| Date |Event  |
|--|--|
|Since 2008|Grantees are encouraged to publish in Gold OA journals. Yet the coverage of APCs was not explicitly regulated. |
|2013.10 |APCs up to 3000 CHF were explicitly allowed to be a part of the project costs (also applied to grants approved before this date).|
|2016.05 |First [OA-Monitoring Report 2013 - 2015](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.584131). It contains an estimation of paid APCs by the SNSF after an sample-based review of financial reports for costs related to publications between October 2013 and August 2015 of the key funding schemes.
|2017.05 |With mySNF Release 6 it became possible to  add APCs as a specific financial item in the budget plan of new grant applications.
|2018.01| An additional form was added to the section of the financial reports in mySNF, where grantees or their financial administration can explicitly report paid APCs and make a link to the publication in the output data section.|
|2018.01|First release of collected data to OpenAPC. Part of the data is the set of the first monitoring period 2013-2015. As this data was extracted from checking samples of financial reports it does not cover all paid APCs of this period. Through a more systematic screening for APCs, the data from 2016-2017 provides a more complete picture. However some paid APCs might have slipped through the screening process.  |
|2018.04|For new grant applications APCs are no longer part of the research budget but can be requested independently. The existing upper limit of 3000 CHF has been temporary removed as part of the [SNSF OA2020 policy](http://www.snf.ch/en/theSNSF/research-policies/open-access/Pages/default.aspx#OA%202020%20Policy).|
|2018.10|A new workflow has been established, where grantees can apply for payment/reimbursement of APCs also for grants that already have expired.|

## CHF to EUR Conversion

Financial Reporting at the SNSF is always done in Swiss Francs (CHF). For OpenAPC all amounts in CHF were converted to EUR. For the conversion, the annual average exchange rate available from the [Swiss National Bank](https://data.snb.ch/de/topics/ziredev#!/cube/devkua?fromDate=2010&toDate=2018&dimSel=D1(EUR1))) was used:

|Year|EUR|CHF|
|--|--|--|
|2009|1|1.51007|
|2010|1|1.38053|
|2011|1|1.23355|
|2012|1|1.20531|
|2013|1|1.23080|
|2014|1|1.21463|
|2015|1|1.06811|
|2016|1|1.09009|
|2017|1|1.11157|
|2018|1|1.15487|
 
## Co-Funding

From 2013.10-2018.03 there existed an upper limit of 3000 CHF for APCs. In cases of higher APCs the SNSF usually covered 3000 CHF and the remaining payment was rejected to the author and/or financial department of the University. The APCs of the following publications have not been paid completely by the SNSF.

## Hybrid

The SNSF does not support Hybrid  OA due to the issue of double dipping. Accidentally some Hybrid-OA charges have slipped trough the internal checking procedure. For the matter of transparence these Hybrid OA Charges are included here.
