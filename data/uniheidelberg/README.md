The present dataset contains information only on publication fees paid from the budget of Heidelberg University's open access publishing fund from 2014 to March 2019. It does not, however, contain comprehensive cost information on Heidelberg University's expenditures for open access APC's. 
Heidelberg University's fund is part of DFG's Open Access Publishing Programme.  Due to pre-pay memberships with BioMed Central and Frontiers some funding applications from 2018 are still pending, because the respective article manuscripts are still under review. Thus, the present dataset is not complete for 2018 yet. More comprehensive data will be released as soon as possible. For more information please see the fund's website mentioned above.
