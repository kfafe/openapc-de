## About

The data content covers APCs as paid for by our central budget for the Max Planck Society (MPS).  APCs funded locally by Max Planck Institutes are not part of this data set.  The MPS has a limited input tax reduction. The refund of input VAT for APC is 20%. Until the end of 2007 the MPS was VAT exempt.
