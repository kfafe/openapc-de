### Motivation: 
The working group within the Austrian consortium (AG Springer Compact) is evaluating the publication output of Springer Compact and aims to compare it with Springer Compact deals in other countries.

The original data provided by Springer for 2016 had errors in assigning institutions correctly. After requesting a new data set, Springer provided a corrected version. There still might be minor errors.
